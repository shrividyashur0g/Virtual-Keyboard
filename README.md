# Virtual-Keyboard

Hi everyone! 
So I decided to code a touchless keyboard using 
 **OpenCV**, **mediapipe** and  **Python**. It allows users to type without touching the keyboard by detecting hand gestures using a webcam! In a world where a lot of resources now have the luxury of being designed digitally, this project focuses on creating an intuitive, hands-free typing experience using computer vision.

## Features
- Type without touching any physical device.
- Detects hand gestures for typing.
- You can change the layout and colour based on your preferences.
- Visual feedback of the typed text on screen.
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux (with appropriate webcam support).

## Installation

### Requirements:
- Python 3.10 or lower versions
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe (for hand tracking)
- NumPy
- CVzone
